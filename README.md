<h2>Devanagari Handwritten Character Image Classification</h2>

==================================================================================

<h3> Overview</h3>

<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The objective of the project is to classify the Davanagari handwritten character image correctly. The dataset can be obtained from UCI repository or Kaggle</p>

==================================================================================

<h3>Dataset</h3>

<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY> The dataset consists a total of 92000 images of which 78200 images belong to training and 13800 images belong to testing.</p>

==================================================================================

<h3>Processing</h3>

<p ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The image data was processed using CNN. The Neural Network contains 12 convolutional layer, 4 max pooling layer and batch normalization was also used for refining the process. The total number of parameters used was 536,694, epochs used was 30, optimizer used was 'adam' and the loss used was 'categorical_crossentropy'.</p>

==================================================================================

<h3>Result</h3>

The  process resulted in a training accuracy of 99.47% and the testing accuracy was found to 97.61%
